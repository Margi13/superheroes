# Superheroes? Why not?

This site is a place where you can create heroes, who are in Bulgaria for one or another reason.

The project has Login and Register functionality, so if you don't want to create heroes you can read other's stories.

Unregistered users can access Home Page and All Heroes Page.
Registered users have more functionality. They have access to all pages: Home, All Heroes, Create and My Heroes page. They can also Edit and Delete own heroes.

Every registered user can also hit the like button on any hero, that's not created by him. And on the Home Page everyone can see the most liked heroes.

Creating heroes is so easy! When creating a hero have to upload drawing image for you hero, and all images are stored in Firebase Storage.

Every try to route to page which url is wrong you'll be navigated to Error Page.

On the bottom of the page are my profiles in LinkdIn and GitHub.

# Server
The server part is from softuni-practice-server, so on every restart of server, data is lost.
